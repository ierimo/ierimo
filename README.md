I’m a cryptography engineer and open source maintainer, specializing in Go.

From 2018 to 2022, I worked on the Go team at Google, where I was in charge of the Go Security team. I implemented TLS 1.3 support in the Go standard library; co-designed the Go Checksum Database, a seamless solution for securing the Go software supply chain with transparency trees; and with my team was responsible for developing features such as native fuzzing and the Go Vulnerability Database, as well as handling vulnerability reports.

Before that, I was at Cloudflare, where I maintained the proprietary Go authoritative DNS server which powers 10% of the Internet, and led the DNSSEC and TLS 1.3 implementations.

Today, I maintain the cryptography packages that ship as part of the Go standard library (crypto/… and golang.org/x/crypto/…), including the TLS, SSH, and low-level implementations, such as elliptic curves, RSA, and ciphers. These packages are critical to virtually every Go application, securing HTTPS requests, implementing authentication, and providing encryption.

I also develop and maintain a set of cryptographic tools, including the file encryption tool age, the development certificate generator mkcert, and the SSH agent yubikey-agent.
